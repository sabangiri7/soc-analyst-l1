"""
Deterministic, dependency-free embedding function - a fallback for when the
default embedding model ChromaDB downloads on first use (a small
sentence-transformer, ~90MB, one-time, needs internet) isn't available:
air-gapped deployments, CI, or offline dev. Also used automatically under
MOCK_MODE so `KnowledgeBase()` never needs network access in tests.

This is NOT a semantic embedding - it's a normalized hashing-trick
bag-of-words vector (same family of technique as scikit-learn's
HashingVectorizer). It only picks up literal shared words between two
texts; it has no notion of meaning, so it won't connect "brute force" with
"credential stuffing" the way the real sentence-transformer model would, and
two texts with zero words in common land as maximally dissimilar even if
they're about the same thing. Retrieval quality is noticeably worse than the
default model - use KB_EMBEDDING_MODE=hashing only when you can't use the
default, not as a general substitute for it.

See rag/knowledge_base.py's `_embedding_function()` for how this is selected.
