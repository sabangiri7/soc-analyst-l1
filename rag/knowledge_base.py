"""
Local RAG store (ChromaDB, on-disk - nothing leaves the box).

Three logical collections, kept separate so retrieval can be targeted:
  - playbooks   : your org's SOPs for handling alert types
  - cases       : closed historical alerts with analyst verdict + reasoning
  - lessons     : short, self-written notes distilled from analyst feedback
                  (this is the "self-improvement" memory - see agent/memory.py)

By default this downloads a small local sentence-embedding model on first use
(one-time, needs internet); everything after that runs fully offline. Set
KB_EMBEDDING_MODE=hashing (or just MOCK_MODE=true, which implies it) to skip
that download entirely and use the deterministic offline embedding in
rag/embeddings.py instead - retrieval quality is worse, but it needs no
network and no model file, which matters for CI, air-gapped deployments, and
tests. A collection's embedding function is fixed at creation time in its
on-disk data; if CHROMA_DB_PATH already has data created under a different
mode, KnowledgeBase falls back to whatever's actually persisted there rather
than erroring - so flipping MOCK_MODE on an existing data dir degrades
gracefully to the embedding it was already using, it doesn't crash.
