"""
propose_action - generic proposal tool.

Some actions a SOC engineer may recommend have no automated executor in the
tool layer (e.g. 'block this IP via active response', 'rotate that credential',
'contact the asset owner'). This tool lets the agent formalize such a
recommendation through the same Approval Center as everything else. Once
approved, execution is *manual*: the proposal records the recommended steps and
the UI marks it as a manual action - the agent never claims it executed.
