"""
Tool substrate for the AI SOC engineer: permission levels, the ToolContext a
tool runs inside, and the BaseWazuhTool interface every tool implements.

Safety model (see docs/permissions.md):

    READ     - executes immediately (search alerts/events, lists, status, ...)
    PROPOSE  - the tool can *plan* and produce a validated configuration, but
               the actual write requires an approved proposal from the
               Approval Center (create/modify rule, decoder, dashboard, ...)
    EXECUTE  - high-risk; requires an approved proposal AND an explicit
               confirmation on top (delete rule, restart manager, disable
               agent, active response, ...)

Enforcement happens in tools/registry.py, not in prompts: a write tool whose
context has no approved proposal returns an ApprovalRequired outcome instead
of performing the write. The LLM can never bypass this by rephrasing, because
the tool itself checks `ctx.approval`.
