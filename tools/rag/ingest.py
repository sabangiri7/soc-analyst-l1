"""
`ingest_wazuh_rules` - pull Wazuh manager rules into the LOCAL RAG knowledge
base so the engineer can recall them offline via retrieve_wazuh_docs.

This is a READ tool: it only ever reads the manager (/rules) and writes to the
on-disk Chroma store (the same memory mechanism as capture_feedback, which
also runs live without approval). It never modifies Wazuh configuration, so it
needs no proposal. Re-runs are idempotent - upsert by rule id - and
delete_missing keeps the corpus in sync as rules come and go on the manager.
