"""
Permission model for the AI SOC engineer.

Three levels, enforced server-side in tools/registry.py:

    READ        automatically permitted (searches, lists, status, ...)
    PROPOSE     the agent may generate/validate the action but the write
                itself requires an approved proposal (create/modify rule,
                decoder, dashboard, configuration)
    EXECUTE     high-risk: requires approval + explicit confirmation
                (delete rule/dashboard, restart manager, disable agent,
                block IP / active response)

Every tool class declares its own level (`permission` attribute on
BaseWazuhTool). This module is the single source of truth for what a level
means, for effective_level() (what a proposed action REALLY needs - a caller
can never downgrade a delete to 'propose'), and for check_can_run() which the
execute path calls before running anything.
