"""
The one code path that executes an approved proposal.

Used by dashboard.py (`POST /api/proposals/<id>/execute`) and by
live_validation/env.py - previously each had its own copy of these checks,
and neither marked a proposal as used, so one approval could be replayed
indefinitely. Order of operations:

  1. load the proposal (time-based expiry applied)
  2. it must be `approved`
  3. EXECUTE-level actions need `confirm=True` - the level is
     permissions.effective_level(), not just what the record says
  4. approvals.claim_for_execution(): atomic approved -> executing. This is
     the single-use gate; a replay/concurrent request fails here
  5. run the real tool with the STORED payload (no LLM involved)
  6. approvals.finish_execution(): executing -> executed | failed
  7. audit the outcome either way
