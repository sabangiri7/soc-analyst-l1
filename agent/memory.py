"""
The self-improvement loop, split into two deliberately separate steps:

  1. capture_feedback() - cheap, synchronous, called every time an analyst
     confirms or overrides the agent's verdict. Just appends to a JSONL log.
     No model call, no memory mutation - this is the raw training signal.

  2. distill_lessons() - run as a periodic batch job (e.g. nightly cron),
     NOT live during triage. Looks at recent corrections, asks Claude to
     find recurring patterns worth remembering, and writes them to the
     "lessons" RAG collection that the triage agent retrieves from.

Why split them: writing memory live, in the same loop that's making
decisions, lets a single noisy or wrong analyst correction immediately
corrupt future triage. Batching + review gives you a checkpoint to catch
that before it goes live. A human should spot-check distilled lessons
before this runs unattended (see review_pending_lessons in main.py).
